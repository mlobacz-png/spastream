**Subject:** Healthcare SaaS Legal Review - Initial Consultation Request

---

Dear [Attorney Name / Firm Name],

I'm reaching out to discuss legal support for **SpaStream**, a HIPAA-compliant practice management platform for medical spas and aesthetic clinics. We're pre-launch and need healthcare technology legal guidance before onboarding our first customers.

**What We Do:**
- Cloud-based SaaS platform for medical spa operations (scheduling, client records, payments, AI-powered features)
- Store Protected Health Information (PHI) - patient records, treatment notes, before/after photos
- Subscription model: $299-$1,499/month + 2% platform fee on payment processing
- Customers: Licensed medical providers in medical spas nationwide

**What We Need:**
1. **Business Associate Agreement (BAA)** - Template for customer contracts (HIPAA required)
2. **BAA with Supabase** - Our infrastructure provider (also HIPAA required)
3. **Contract Review** - We have draft MSA, DPA, SLA, and AUP that need healthcare tech attorney review
4. **Payment Processing Terms** - Guidance on our 2% platform fee structure and Stripe integration
5. **Compliance Guidance** - HIPAA technical safeguards review, breach notification procedures

**Timeline:**
We plan to launch within 60-90 days. The BAA is blocking our first customer onboarding, so this is our highest priority.

**Budget:**
We understand healthcare tech legal work typically ranges from $5,000-$15,000 for initial document creation and review. We're open to discussing scope and phasing.

**Request:**
Would you be available for a 30-minute initial consultation to discuss your experience with healthcare SaaS clients, review our needs, and provide a proposal?

I'm happy to share our existing legal templates and technical documentation ahead of time if that's helpful.

Thank you for considering this request. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
Founder, SpaStream
