# Decision Makers & Outreach Strategy Guide

## Typical Decision Makers in MedSpa/Aesthetic Practices

### 1. **Owner/Medical Director** (Primary Decision Maker - 80% of cases)
**Profile:**
- Usually a physician (MD/DO), nurse practitioner, or physician assistant
- Wears multiple hats: clinical provider, business owner, marketer
- Age range: 35-60
- Concerned with: Revenue, compliance, growth, time savings

**Pain Points:**
- Overwhelmed with administrative work
- Struggling to scale beyond their personal capacity
- Worried about compliance and liability
- Want to increase revenue without working more hours
- Frustrated with staff turnover and training

**Decision Criteria:**
- ROI and revenue impact (most important)
- HIPAA compliance and security
- Ease of implementation (they're busy)
- Quality of support
- Ability to work remotely/on mobile

**Best Messaging:**
- "Get back to patient care, not paperwork"
- "Scale your practice without scaling your stress"
- "Increase revenue by 30-40% without adding hours"

---

### 2. **Practice Manager/Operations Manager** (Influencer - 60% involved)
**Profile:**

**Finding Emails:**
- Practice websites (contact page)
- Hunter.io, Apollo.io, or similar tools
- LinkedIn (sometimes listed)
- Call the practice and ask: "What's the best email to reach [Owner]?"

**Email Sequence (Best Practices):**

**Email 1: The Problem Email**
Subject: [First Name], losing clients to poor follow-up?

> Hi [First Name],
>
> I was looking at [Practice Name]'s website and noticed you offer [specific service]. Beautiful work!
>
> Quick question: how are you currently handling appointment reminders and client follow-ups?
>
> I ask because most aesthetic practices we work with lose 20-30% of potential rebookings simply because clients forget to rescheduled or don't receive timely follow-ups.
>
> We've built a platform specifically for medical spas that automates all of this (plus AI-powered treatment recommendations, dynamic pricing, and more). Our clients typically see 30-40% revenue increases in year one.
>
> Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call to see if this could work for [Practice Name]?
>
> Best,
> [Your Name]
>
> P.S. If you're not the right person for this conversation, could you point me to who is?

**Email 2 (3 days later): The Social Proof Email**
Subject: Re: [First Name], losing clients to poor follow-up?

> Hi [First Name],
>
> Just wanted to follow up in case my last email got buried.
>

> - Reduced no-shows by 42%
> - Increased rebooking rate from 45% to 68%
> - Saved 12 hours/week on admin work
>
> All from automating client communications and using AI to recommend the right treatments at the right time.
>
> Would love to show you how this could work for [Practice Name]. Are you free for a quick call this week?
>
> [Your Name]

**Email 3 (4 days later): The Breakup Email**
Subject: Should I close your file?

> Hi [First Name],
>
> I haven't heard back so I'm assuming this isn't a priority right now (or I've been going to spam - it happens!).
>
> Before I close your file, I wanted to ask:
>
> 1. Is streamlining operations something you're interested in, just not right now?
> 2. Or is this just not a fit for [Practice Name]?
>
> If it's timing, I'm happy to follow up in [3 months / after busy season / etc.]. If it's not a fit, no worries - just let me know so I stop bothering you!
>
> Either way, I put together a free resource on [relevant topic] that you might find valuable: [link]
>
> Cheers,
> [Your Name]

**Pro Tips:**
- Send Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10am local time
- Keep emails under 150 words
- Personalize the first line (mention something specific about their practice)
- One CTA per email
- Use plain text (no HTML) - looks more personal

---

### 5. **Instagram/Facebook DMs** ⭐⭐⭐
**Conversion Rate:** 5-12% (if they're active)

**Why It Works:**
- Medspa owners are VERY active on Instagram (it's their primary marketing channel)
- More personal and casual than email
- Can see their work and engagement

**Strategy:**
- Follow their account

>
> Would you be open to a quick chat? I'd love to share what's worked for other practices dealing with the same thing. No pressure either way!"

**Follow-up (if no response in 4 days):**
> "Hey! Just wanted to make sure you saw my last message. I know DMs can get buried. If you're interested in chatting about [pain point], I'm around. If not, no worries - keep crushing it! 💪"

### 6. **Google Ads / Facebook Ads** ⭐⭐⭐
**Conversion Rate:** 2-5% (but scalable)

**Why It Works:**

### 7. **Phone Calls (Cold Calling)** ⭐⭐
**Conversion Rate:** 1-3% (but immediate feedback)

**Why It's Tough:**
- Receptionists are gatekeepers
- Decision makers are busy with clients
- Feels intrusive

**When It Works:**
- Follow-up to email or LinkedIn message
- After they've visited your website
- Regional/local outreach (mention you're local)

**Script:**
> "Hi, this is [Name] calling for [Owner Name]. Is she available?"
>
> [If gatekeeper asks what it's about]:
> "I'm following up on an email I sent about streamlining operations. She requested some information."
>
> [If you get through]:
> "Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] - did I catch you at a bad time? [Wait for response] Great - I'll keep this quick. I work with aesthetic practices to automate client communications and boost revenue. I noticed [Practice Name] does [specific treatment], and I wanted to share how practices like yours are seeing 30-40% revenue increases through better follow-up. Would you be open to a 15-minute demo sometime this week?"

**Pro Tips:**
- Call early morning (7:30-8:30am) or late afternoon (4-5pm) when owners might answer directly
- Be respectful of their time
- Have a clear reason for calling beyond "just checking in"

---

### 8. **Content Marketing / SEO** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Long-term)
**Conversion Rate:** 15-25% (but takes 6-12 months)

**Strategy:**
- Blog posts targeting medspa owner pain points
- "Best Medspa Software" comparison articles
- YouTube videos showing features
- Free tools (ROI calculator, growth assessment, etc.)
- Podcast interviews on medspa/aesthetic industry podcasts

**Sample Topics:**
- "How to Reduce No-Shows in Your Medical Spa"
- "5 Ways to Increase Client Retention in Aesthetic Practices"
- "Medical Spa Software Comparison: [Your Platform] vs. Mindbody vs. Boulevard"
- "How to Automate Your Medspa and Get Back to Patient Care"

**Goal:** Rank on Google for terms owners are searching when they're ready to buy.

---

### 9. **Partnerships & Affiliates** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Conversion Rate:** 20-30% (from qualified referrals)

**Partner Types:**
- Laser equipment companies (Candela, Cynosure, Cutera, etc.)
- Product distributors (Allergan, Merz, Galderma reps)
- Practice consultants and coaches
- Medical spa attorneys
- Interior designers who work with medspas
- Medical spa franchises

**Pitch to Partners:**
> "We work with a lot of the same clients. What if we did a revenue share where you refer practices to us and we give you [15-20%] of their first year subscription? You're already talking to them about equipment/products/legal - this is an easy add-on that makes their practice more successful."

---

## Multi-Channel Outreach Sequence (Most Effective)

Don't rely on just one channel. Here's a proven sequence:

### Week 1:
- **Day 1:** LinkedIn connection request
- **Day 3:** LinkedIn message after connection
- **Day 5:** Email #1

### Week 2:
- **Day 8:** Email #2
- **Day 10:** Instagram/Facebook engagement (like/comment on posts)
- **Day 12:** LinkedIn follow-up message

### Week 3:
- **Day 15:** Instagram DM
- **Day 17:** Email #3 (breakup email)
- **Day 19:** Phone call

### Week 4-8:
- Stay top-of-mind with valuable content
- Comment on their social posts
- Share relevant industry insights
- Wait for them to reach back out

**Why This Works:**
- Multiple touchpoints increase familiarity
- Shows you're persistent but not desperate
- Meets them where they're most active
- Provides value throughout

---

## Red Flags (Time Wasters)

**Don't Waste Time On:**
- "Just browsing" with no pain points
- Practices under 6 months old (too early)
- Owner who just bought NEW software recently (wait 6-12 months)
- "Send me information" with no follow-up meeting (they're not serious)
- Wants custom development before committing
- Won't give you a budget range ("how much does it cost?")

---

## Qualification Questions (Ask Early)

Before you invest time in demos and proposals:

1. **"What problem are you trying to solve?"** (No problem = no urgency)
2. **"What are you using now, and what's not working?"** (Understand their pain)
3. **"If this works, when would you want to be up and running?"** (Timeline/urgency)
4. **"Who else needs to be involved in this decision?"** (Decision-making process)
5. **"What's your budget range for a solution like this?"** (Affordability)

If they can't answer these clearly, they're not ready to buy.

---

## Final Pro Tips

1. **Personalization wins** - Generic outreach gets ignored. Mention their practice name, specific treatments, or recent Instagram post.

2. **Lead with value, not features** - They don't care about "cloud-based scheduling." They care about "getting 10 hours back per week."

3. **Speak their language** - Use industry terms (injections, facials, laser treatments) to show you understand their world.

4. **Follow up relentlessly** - Most deals happen after 5-7 touchpoints. The fortune is in the follow-up.

5. **Ask for referrals early** - "Even if this isn't a fit for you, who else do you know that might benefit?"

6. **Build relationships, not just sales** - Join their Facebook groups, comment on LinkedIn posts, be a resource. When they're ready to buy, they'll think of you.

7. **Test and track** - Use a CRM to track which channels and messages convert best. Double down on what works.

---

## Recommended Tools

- **CRM:** HubSpot (free), Pipedrive, or Close.com
- **Email Finder:** Hunter.io, Apollo.io
- **Email Tracking:** Mailtrack, HubSpot
- **LinkedIn Automation:** LinkedIn Sales Navigator (manual is better though)
- **Calendar Booking:** Calendly, TidyCal
- **Call Tracking:** Aircall, OpenPhone

---

**Remember:** You're not just selling software - you're helping practices grow. Focus on understanding their pain, providing value, and building trust. The sale will follow.
