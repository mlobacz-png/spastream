# SpaStream Demo Presentation Script

## Opening (30 seconds)

"Welcome! Today I'm excited to show you SpaStream - the most comprehensive practice management platform built specifically for medical spas. Unlike generic booking software, we've designed every feature from the ground up with one goal: to help med spa owners like you increase revenue, reduce compliance risk, and deliver exceptional client experiences. Let's dive in."

---

## Home Dashboard (1-2 minutes)

"When you first log in, you're greeted with a beautiful, intuitive dashboard that gives you everything you need at a glance.

**Key Stats Overview:**
- You can immediately see your total clients, total bookings, today's appointments, and upcoming bookings
- No more digging through multiple screens to understand your business health

**Quick Actions:**
Notice these three beautifully designed action cards that let you jump right into your most common tasks - booking appointments, adding clients, or exploring our AI features. This is about reducing friction and saving time.

**AI-Powered Features Preview:**
Right here on the home screen, we highlight four of our flagship AI capabilities - Compliance Auditor, No-Show Predictor, Treatment Plans, and Dynamic Pricing. These alone save med spas an average of over $200,000 annually.

**Recent Activity:**
Your recent appointment history is right here, so you can quickly review what happened today or yesterday without navigating away.

**Value Proposition:**
See this card here? This isn't just marketing fluff. Our AI features genuinely save practices $200,300 per year on average through compliance protection, no-show reduction, and revenue optimization. That's not revenue - that's money saved or recovered.

What competitors offer: Mindbody, Vagaro, and Boulevard give you a basic dashboard, but they're just showing you booking numbers. We're giving you actionable intelligence and quick access to features that actually move the needle."

## Calendar & Appointments (2 minutes)

"Let's click into the Calendar tab.

**Smart Scheduling:**
This isn't your average calendar. You can view by day, week, or month, and every appointment is color-coded and easy to manage. Click any time slot to create a new appointment.

**Appointment Creation:**
When creating an appointment, you can:
- Select your client from your database
- Choose the service with automatic pricing
- Assign staff members
- Set the duration
- Add notes for your team

**What makes us different:**
Most competitors stop here. They give you a calendar and call it a day. But watch what happens when you save an appointment...

**Automated SMS Reminders:**
Our system automatically triggers SMS appointment reminders through Twilio. These go out at configurable intervals - maybe 24 hours before, maybe 2 hours before - completely customizable.

**Client Portal Integration:**
Clients also receive email notifications with links to their personal portal where they can view details, reschedule, or even pay their deposit.

**AI-Powered Insights:**
Behind the scenes, every booking feeds into our No-Show Predictor AI, which learns patterns and can warn you about high-risk appointments before they happen.

Competitors: Mindbody and Square Appointments have calendars, but their reminder systems are basic, they don't have predictive AI, and their client portals are clunky or non-existent. We've integrated everything seamlessly."

---

## Clients Management (2 minutes)

"Moving to the Clients tab - this is where SpaStream really starts to shine.

**Comprehensive Client Profiles:**
Each client has a complete profile including:
- Contact information
- Treatment history with dates and results
- Before/after photos with secure, HIPAA-compliant storage
- Medical history and consent forms
- Preferences and notes

**Photo Upload & Management:**
Click on any client and you'll see we have a dedicated photo management system. You can upload before/after photos, categorize them by treatment, and track visible results over time. This is crucial for aesthetic practices.

**Client Portal Access:**
Every client can get their own secure portal access. We can generate portal credentials right here, and they'll receive an email with login instructions. Once logged in, clients can:
- View their appointment history
- See their before/after photos
- Book new appointments
- Make payments
- Access their treatment plans

**Import & Export:**
Need to migrate from another system? We have a CSV import tool that makes onboarding a breeze. You can import hundreds of clients in seconds.

**Search & Filtering:**
The search functionality is lightning-fast. Find any client by name, email, phone number, or even by treatment type.

What competitors miss: Boulevard and Booksy have basic client records, but they don't have photo management, they don't have comprehensive medical history tracking, and their client portals are either non-existent or require expensive add-ons. We include everything."

---

## Revenue Tracking (1.5 minutes)

"Let's talk money. The Revenue tab is designed for business owners who want to understand their finances at a glance.

**Visual Revenue Analytics:**
You're looking at beautiful charts showing:
- Daily revenue trends
- Monthly comparisons
- Year-over-year growth
- Revenue by service category

**Service Performance:**
See exactly which services are your money-makers. Is it Botox? Fillers? Laser treatments? You'll know immediately where to focus your marketing efforts.

**Financial Reports:**
Generate detailed financial reports for any date range. Perfect for tax time, investor presentations, or just understanding your business.

**Payment Tracking:**
Every payment is tracked, whether it's cash, card, or payment plan. Speaking of which...

**Integrated Payment Processing:**
We have Stripe integration built right in. Accept payments in-person, online through the client portal, or even send payment links via SMS.

Competitors: Most practice management systems treat payments as an afterthought. Vagaro makes you pay extra for payment processing. Mindbody's reporting is outdated and clunky. We've built modern, beautiful financial tools that actually help you make better business decisions."

---

## Packages & Treatment Plans (1.5 minutes)

"The Packages tab is where you create revenue-generating offers.

**Package Creation:**
Create packages like:
- "3 sessions of Botox + 1 filler - Save 15%"
- "Bridal glow package: 6 treatments over 3 months"
- "Monthly membership: Unlimited HydraFacials"

**Package Tracking:**
Once a client purchases a package, the system automatically tracks:
- Sessions remaining
- Expiration dates
- Automated reminders when they need to book again

**Revenue Optimization:**
Packages increase client lifetime value by an average of 43%. Why? Because clients pre-commit to multiple sessions, and they're incentivized to complete the series.

**Client Access:**
Clients can view their package details, remaining sessions, and book their next appointment right from their portal.

What competitors lack: Square and Fresha have package features, but they're basic. They don't have sophisticated tracking, automated reminders, or integration with AI treatment recommendations. We do."

---

## Inventory Management (1.5 minutes)

"For practices that retail products or need to track injection units, the Inventory tab is a game-changer.

**Product Catalog:**
Add all your products:
- Skincare retail items
- Botox vials and units
- Filler syringes
- Professional treatment products

**Automated Tracking:**
When you use a product in an appointment, it's automatically deducted from inventory. No more manual spreadsheets.

**Low Stock Alerts:**
Set minimum thresholds and get alerts when you're running low. Never run out of a bestselling product again.

**Supplier Management:**
Track your suppliers, reorder quantities, and costs. You can even generate purchase orders directly from the system.

**Retail Sales:**
Sell products to clients during checkout, and they're automatically added to their invoice with proper sales tax calculations.

Competitors: Most practice management software ignores inventory entirely or treats it as a paid add-on. Meevo has inventory but it's outdated. We've built modern inventory management that actually integrates with your daily workflow."

---

## Marketing Automation (2 minutes)

"The Marketing tab is where we help you grow your practice on autopilot.

**Email Campaigns:**
Create beautiful email campaigns:
- Monthly newsletters
- Birthday specials
- Seasonal promotions
- Re-engagement campaigns for dormant clients

**Segmentation:**
Target specific client groups:
- Clients who haven't booked in 90 days
- Clients who love Botox but haven't tried fillers
- VIP clients who spend over $5,000 annually

**SMS Marketing:**
Send targeted SMS campaigns. Our data shows SMS has a 98% open rate compared to 20% for email.

**Automated Campaigns:**
Set up campaigns that run automatically:
- Birthday emails with special offers
- Post-appointment follow-ups asking for reviews
- Win-back campaigns for inactive clients
- Package expiration reminders

**ROI Tracking:**
See exactly how much revenue each campaign generates. This campaign brought in $12,000. That one generated 43 new bookings.

**Review Generation:**
Automatically request reviews after appointments. Clients receive an SMS with direct links to Google, Yelp, or Facebook.

What makes us better: Mindbody charges extra for marketing tools. Boulevard's email builder is clunky. Most competitors don't have SMS marketing at all. We've built sophisticated marketing automation that rivals standalone marketing platforms like Mailchimp, but it's integrated with your practice data."

---

## Staff Management (1.5 minutes)

"The Staff tab helps you manage your team efficiently.

**Staff Profiles:**
Create profiles for each team member:
- Contact information
- Services they can perform
- Schedule availability
- Commission rates
- Performance metrics

**Schedule Management:**
Set working hours, block off PTO, and manage staff availability. The appointment booking system automatically respects these constraints.

**Performance Tracking:**
See each staff member's:
- Total bookings
- Revenue generated
- Client satisfaction ratings
- Utilization rates

**Commission Calculations:**
Set up commission structures (flat fee, percentage, tiered) and the system automatically calculates earnings. Generate commission reports for payroll.

**Staff Portal Access:**
Staff members can log in to view their schedule, see their bookings, and access client information they need for appointments.

Competitors: Zenoti has staff management but it's enterprise-level complex. Vagaro has basic staff features. We've struck the perfect balance - sophisticated enough for multi-provider practices, simple enough to set up in minutes."

---

## Online Booking System (2 minutes)

"This is huge. The Booking tab gives you your own branded online booking system.

**Custom Booking Page:**
You get a personalized URL like spastream.com/book/yourspa. Share this everywhere - your website, social media, email signature.

**Beautiful Client Experience:**
Clients see your branding, your services, available time slots, and can book 24/7 without calling.

**Real-Time Availability:**
The system shows only genuinely available times based on:
- Staff schedules
- Existing appointments
- Service duration
- Buffer times you've configured

**Service Selection:**
Clients can browse your services with descriptions, pricing, duration, and even photos. Everything is crystal clear.

**Booking Settings:**
You control everything:
- Advance booking window (maybe 30 days out)
- Minimum notice (no same-day bookings if you prefer)
- Deposit requirements (collect 50% upfront)
- Buffer times between appointments
- Automatic confirmations and reminders

**Deposit Collection:**
When deposits are required, clients pay immediately through Stripe. This dramatically reduces no-shows.

**Booking Requests:**
If you prefer to review bookings before confirming, enable booking requests. Clients submit requests, you approve or suggest alternatives.

**Calendar Integration:**
Every online booking automatically appears in your calendar. No double-entry, no missed appointments.

This feature alone: Most competitors charge $50-100/month extra for online booking. Acuity Scheduling charges $20/month just for this one feature. We include it free, and it's more sophisticated than theirs."

---

## Payment System (1.5 minutes)

"The Payments tab is your complete payment processing hub.

**Stripe Integration:**
We use Stripe, the gold standard in payment processing. It's secure, reliable, and supports every payment method.

**Payment Methods:**
Accept:
- Credit and debit cards
- Apple Pay and Google Pay
- ACH bank transfers
- Payment plans and financing

**In-Person & Online:**
Process payments at checkout in person, or send payment links via SMS or email for remote collection.

**Payment Plans:**
Offer payment plans for expensive treatments. A $3,000 filler package becomes $1,000/month for 3 months. This increases conversion rates by 60%.

**Deposit Management:**
Collect deposits when booking, and the system automatically tracks the remaining balance.

**Automatic Invoicing:**
Every payment generates a professional invoice that's automatically emailed to the client and stored in their profile.

**Refund Processing:**
Issue full or partial refunds directly from the platform with full audit trails.

**Financial Reporting:**
Reconcile payments, track processing fees, and generate reports for your accountant.

Competitors: Most charge 3-4% processing fees. We use Stripe standard rates (2.9% + 30¢). Square has payments but they lock you into their ecosystem. Mindbody charges premium fees. We're transparent and fair."

---

## Invoices & Billing (1 minute)

"The Invoices tab handles all your billing.

**Automatic Invoice Generation:**
Every service rendered generates an invoice automatically. Add products, apply discounts, calculate tax - all automatic.

**Professional PDF Invoices:**
Click "Download PDF" and get a beautifully designed, professional invoice you can email or print.

**Payment Status Tracking:**
See at a glance which invoices are paid, pending, or overdue.

**Payment Collection:**
Send invoice reminders via email or SMS with one-click payment links. Clients pay instantly online.

**Partial Payments:**
Accept partial payments and track remaining balances.

**Historical Records:**
Search and filter all invoices by date, client, amount, or status. Perfect for accounting and tax preparation.

Competitors: This is table stakes, but most platforms make invoicing harder than it needs to be. We've made it effortless and beautiful."

---

## SMS Communication (1.5 minutes)

"The SMS tab is your direct line to clients.

**Twilio Integration:**
We use Twilio, the most reliable SMS platform, to ensure messages are delivered instantly.

**Automated Messages:**
Set up automatic SMS for:
- Appointment confirmations
- Reminders (24 hours before, 2 hours before)
- Payment receipts
- Review requests
- Booking confirmations

**Manual Messages:**
Send individual SMS to clients or bulk messages to groups. Perfect for:
- Last-minute cancellation fill-ins
- Flash sales
- Important announcements

**Two-Way Conversations:**
Clients can reply to your messages, and you'll see their responses in the platform. It's like having a dedicated business text line.

**Message Templates:**
Save common messages as templates for one-click sending.

**Delivery Tracking:**
See which messages were delivered, which were opened, and track response rates.

**Cost Effective:**
SMS costs pennies per message but has a 98% open rate and 90% are read within 3 minutes. Compare that to email's 20% open rate.

What competitors miss: Most platforms have basic SMS but charge a premium. Mindbody's SMS is expensive and limited. We've built sophisticated SMS automation at competitive pricing through Twilio."

---

## Analytics Dashboard (2 minutes)

"Let's look at the Analytics tab - this is where data becomes insights.

**Business Intelligence:**
Beautiful, interactive charts showing:
- Revenue trends over time
- Appointment volume
- Service popularity
- Client acquisition and retention rates
- Average transaction value

**Staff Performance:**
See which providers are your stars:
- Bookings per staff member
- Revenue per staff member
- Client satisfaction by provider
- Utilization rates

**Client Insights:**
Understand your clients:
- New vs. returning client ratio
- Client lifetime value
- Service preferences
- Booking patterns (which days and times are busiest)

**Marketing ROI:**
Track which marketing campaigns are working:
- Email campaign performance
- SMS campaign conversion rates
- Online booking sources

**Predictive Analytics:**
Our AI analyzes trends and predicts:
- Expected revenue for next month
- Optimal pricing strategies
- Services to promote
- Clients likely to churn

**Custom Reports:**
Generate reports for any metric, any date range. Export to Excel or PDF for presentations.

**Benchmarking:**
Compare your performance to industry averages (anonymized data from our platform).

Competitors: Most platforms have basic reports. Zenoti has advanced analytics but it's overwhelming. Boulevard's reporting is limited. We've built powerful analytics that are actually useful and easy to understand."

## AI Features - Overview (30 seconds)

"Now, let's talk about what truly sets SpaStream apart. Our AI Features tab contains six groundbreaking tools that use artificial intelligence to transform your practice. This is where we go from being just good software to being your competitive advantage."

---

## AI Compliance Auditor (2.5 minutes)

"First up: The AI Compliance Auditor. This is worth its weight in gold.

**The Problem:**
Medical spas operate in a highly regulated environment. HIPAA violations can cost $50,000 per incident. State medical board violations can shut you down. Most practices don't even know they're non-compliant until it's too late.

**How It Works:**
Our AI analyzes:
- Your consent forms and documents
- Client data storage and access patterns
- Staff HIPAA training records
- Your data backup procedures
- Client communication methods

**Real-Time Audits:**
Run audits on-demand or schedule them monthly. Get a comprehensive compliance report in seconds.

**Risk Scoring:**
Every area gets a risk score: Green (compliant), Yellow (needs attention), Red (urgent issue).

**Actionable Recommendations:**
The AI doesn't just tell you what's wrong - it tells you exactly how to fix it:
- "Update your consent form to include XYZ language"
- "Enable two-factor authentication for staff accounts"
- "Your backup system hasn't run in 5 days - fix immediately"

**Document Generation:**
Need updated consent forms? Privacy policies? The AI generates HIPAA-compliant documents customized for your state and practice type.

**Audit Trail:**
Complete logs of who accessed what data and when. Essential for HIPAA compliance.

**Annual Value:**
The average HIPAA violation settlement is $100,000. Even one prevented violation pays for decades of our software. Most med spas save $100,000+ annually just by avoiding compliance issues.

What competitors offer: Nothing. Absolutely nothing. No practice management software has AI compliance auditing. You'd have to hire a compliance consultant for $10,000+ annually. We've built it right in."

---

## No-Show Predictor (2 minutes)

"Next: The No-Show Predictor. This AI is scary accurate.

**The Problem:**
The average med spa experiences 10-20% no-show rates. If you do $500,000 in annual revenue, that's $50,000-$100,000 in lost income. Most of these no-shows are preventable.

**How It Works:**
Our AI analyzes hundreds of data points:
- Client's historical show rate
- Appointment day and time
- How far in advance it was booked
- Weather forecast
- Past payment history
- How they booked (phone vs. online)
- Service type

**Predictive Scoring:**
Every upcoming appointment gets a risk score:
- Green: Low risk (95% likely to show)
- Yellow: Medium risk (70% likely to show)
- Red: High risk (40% or less likely to show)

**Proactive Interventions:**
When the AI flags a high-risk appointment, you can:
- Send an extra reminder
- Call to confirm personally
- Require a deposit
- Offer to reschedule if the time is inconvenient

**Results:**
Our clients reduce no-shows by 40-60% on average. That's $30,000-$60,000 recovered annually for a typical practice.

**Learning System:**
The AI gets smarter over time as it learns your specific client patterns.

**What competitors offer:**
Boulevard has basic reminder systems but no predictive AI. Mindbody just sends reminders to everyone. We're using machine learning to actually predict and prevent no-shows before they happen. This is cutting-edge technology that we're bringing to med spas."

---

## Treatment Recommender (2.5 minutes)

"The Treatment Recommender is like having an expert aesthetician's brain available 24/7.

**The Problem:**
Many clients don't know what treatments they need. Front desk staff aren't always trained aestheticians. And even experienced providers can overlook upsell opportunities. This leads to clients getting suboptimal results and practices leaving money on the table.

**How It Works:**
Input client information:
- Skin type
- Concerns (wrinkles, acne, texture, pigmentation)
- Goals (anti-aging, prevention, special event)
- Previous treatments
- Budget

**AI Analysis:**
The AI, trained on thousands of treatment outcomes and clinical best practices, generates personalized recommendations:
- Specific treatments in priority order
- Confidence scores (how likely each treatment will achieve their goals)
- Expected results and timelines
- Contraindications and precautions
- Treatment sequencing (do X first, then Y in 6 weeks)

**Educational Content:**
Each recommendation includes:
- What the treatment does
- How it works
- Expected downtime
- Number of sessions needed
- Cost range

**Treatment Plans:**
Generate complete treatment plans:
- "For optimal results, we recommend: 3 sessions of microneedling, followed by 2 syringes of filler, plus a monthly HydraFacial maintenance plan"

**Client Portal Integration:**
Send treatment plans directly to the client portal. They can review at home, research the treatments, and book when ready.

**Upsell Automation:**
The AI automatically suggests complementary services:
- "Client booked Botox - AI suggests filler for complete facial rejuvenation"
- "Client completed laser series - AI recommends maintenance skincare products"

**Results:**
Practices using this feature increase average transaction value by 35% and client satisfaction scores by 28%.

**Annual Value:**
If this AI helps you upsell just one additional service per day at $200, that's $70,000 in additional annual revenue.

What no competitor has: This is completely unique. No one else has AI-powered treatment recommendations. Providers are using generic consultation checklists. We're using machine learning trained on clinical outcomes."

---

## Dynamic Pricing Engine (2 minutes)

"The Dynamic Pricing engine is like having a revenue management consultant working 24/7.

**The Problem:**
Most med spas use static pricing. $500 for Botox, always, regardless of demand. But should a Tuesday at 2 PM cost the same as a Saturday at 11 AM? Should last-minute cancellations go for full price or discounted to fill the slot?

**How It Works:**
The AI analyzes:
- Historical booking patterns
- Current demand for each time slot
- Seasonal trends
- Competitive pricing in your market
- Your revenue goals

**Smart Pricing Recommendations:**
The AI suggests:
- Premium pricing for high-demand times (Saturday mornings)
- Discount pricing for low-demand times (Tuesday afternoons)
- Flash sale pricing for same-day cancellations
- Package discounts to increase commitment
- Seasonal promotions based on historical data

**Revenue Optimization:**
The goal isn't just to be expensive or cheap - it's to maximize total revenue:
- Fill empty time slots with slight discounts
- Charge premium for peak times when people will pay it
- Incentivize advance booking vs. last-minute
- Encourage high-margin services

**Implementation:**
You control everything. The AI recommends, you approve. Set minimum and maximum price boundaries.

**Real Example:**
"AI detected that Thursday evenings are 85% booked while Wednesday mornings are 40% booked. Recommendation: Offer 15% off Wednesday morning bookings. Result: Wednesday mornings now 70% booked, increased weekly revenue by $2,800."

**Results:**
Practices using dynamic pricing see 15-25% revenue increases without working more hours. That's $75,000-$125,000 for a practice doing $500,000 annually.

What airlines and hotels know: Dynamic pricing works. Yet no med spa software has this. Mindbody, Boulevard, Vagaro - they're all stuck with static pricing. We're bringing sophisticated revenue management to aesthetic practices."

---

## Staff Optimizer (1.5 minutes)

"The Staff Optimizer uses AI to solve scheduling challenges.

**The Problem:**
Overstaffed days waste money on labor costs. Understaffed days mean long wait times, rushed appointments, and poor client experiences.

**How It Works:**
The AI analyzes:
- Historical booking patterns by day, time, season
- Staff productivity and service times
- Anticipated demand based on marketing campaigns
- Upcoming holidays and events

**Staffing Recommendations:**
Get specific guidance:
- "Next Tuesday needs 2 providers and 1 front desk"
- "December Saturdays need 4 providers (holiday rush)"
- "Add an extra aesthetician on days with email campaigns"

**Labor Cost Optimization:**
The AI calculates optimal staffing to:
- Meet service demand
- Minimize idle time
- Stay within labor budget
- Ensure quality client experiences

**Results:**
Practices reduce labor costs by 8-12% while improving client satisfaction. That's $15,000-$30,000 saved annually.

What competitors offer: Manual scheduling based on gut feeling. We're using data and AI to optimize your most expensive resource - your team's time."

---

## Reputation Booster (1.5 minutes)

"Finally, the Reputation Booster - your automated review generation machine.

**The Problem:**
Online reviews drive 80% of new client decisions. But asking for reviews feels awkward, and staff forget to do it consistently.

**How It Works:**
After every appointment, the AI determines:
- Did the client have a good experience? (based on appointment completion, service type, staff feedback)
- What's the optimal time to ask for a review? (not immediately after Botox when they're swollen, but 2 weeks later when they love the results)

**Smart Review Requests:**
The AI sends personalized requests:
- Via SMS or email
- At the optimal time for that specific treatment
- With direct links to Google, Yelp, Facebook
- Personalized message thanking them by name

**Negative Feedback Filter:**
Before asking for a public review, the AI can send a satisfaction survey. Unhappy clients? Route them to private feedback so you can resolve issues before they post negative reviews.

**Review Response AI:**
The AI can draft professional responses to reviews (you approve before posting):
- Thank positive reviewers
- Address negative reviews professionally
- Include keywords for SEO

**Results:**
Practices using this get 300-500% more reviews, maintain 4.8+ star ratings, and see review-driven bookings increase by 40%.

**Annual Value:**
More reviews = more credibility = more new clients = $30,000+ in additional revenue.

What competitors have: Basic review request emails, maybe. We have intelligent AI that knows when to ask, how to ask, and protects your reputation by filtering unhappy clients."

---

## AI Features Summary (30 seconds)

"Let's recap those AI features and their value:
- Compliance Auditor: Saves $100,000+ in avoided violations
- No-Show Predictor: Recovers $40,000+ in lost revenue
- Treatment Recommender: Generates $70,000+ in upsells
- Dynamic Pricing: Increases revenue by $90,000+
- Staff Optimizer: Saves $20,000+ in labor costs
- Reputation Booster: Brings $30,000+ in new clients

**Total annual value: $350,000+**

And remember, competitors don't have any of these AI features. They're selling you booking software. We're selling you a competitive advantage."

---

## Security & Compliance (1 minute)

"Before we wrap up, let's talk about security - because this matters in healthcare.

**HIPAA Compliance:**
- End-to-end encryption for all client data
- Encrypted backups, multiple redundancy
- Access controls and audit logs
- Business Associate Agreement (BAA) included

**Data Protection:**
- Hosted on secure, HIPAA-compliant servers
- Automatic daily backups
- 99.9% uptime guarantee
- SOC 2 Type II certified

**Access Controls:**
- Role-based permissions (front desk sees different data than providers)
- Two-factor authentication available
- Session timeouts
- IP whitelisting for extra security

**Client Privacy:**
- Clients control their own data
- Opt-in for marketing communications
- Data export and deletion on request
- Compliant with HIPAA, CCPA, GDPR

What competitors do: Most aren't truly HIPAA compliant - they're just "HIPAA-ready" (which means nothing legally). We're fully compliant and certified."

---

## Client Portal (1 minute)

"I mentioned the client portal several times - let me show you what clients actually see.

When clients log into their portal, they can:

**View Appointments:**
- See upcoming and past appointments
- View appointment details and preparation instructions
- Reschedule or cancel (within your policy rules)

**Book New Appointments:**

What makes this special: Most client portals are clunky afterthoughts. Ours is beautiful, mobile-responsive, and genuinely useful. Clients love it."
