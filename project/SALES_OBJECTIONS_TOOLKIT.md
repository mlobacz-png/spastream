# Sales Objections Toolkit

## Common Objections & Response Framework

### 1. "We're already using [Competitor] and it works fine"

**Objection Type:** Status Quo Bias

**Response Strategy:**
- Acknowledge their current solution
- Focus on what they're missing, not what's broken
- Emphasize growth potential vs. maintenance

**Sample Response:**
> "I completely understand - you've invested time in learning your current system. Many of our clients said the same thing before switching. The question isn't whether [Competitor] works, but whether it's helping you *grow*. Our clients typically see 30-40% revenue increases in their first year because we automate the revenue-generating activities that most platforms overlook - like AI-powered treatment recommendations that increase service bookings, automated review requests that build your reputation, and dynamic pricing that maximizes your revenue per appointment. What would an extra $50,000-$100,000 in annual revenue mean for your practice?"

**Follow-up Questions:**
- "How much time does your team spend on scheduling and reminders each week?"
- "Are you tracking client retention rates and lifetime value?"
- "When was the last time your software helped you identify a revenue opportunity you were missing?"

---

### 2. "Switching systems sounds like a hassle"

**Objection Type:** Change Aversion / Implementation Concern

**Response Strategy:**
- Make it concrete and simple
- Remove the burden from them
- Emphasize the temporary pain vs. long-term gain

**Sample Response:**
> "I hear this a lot, and honestly, that's why we built our onboarding process the way we did. Here's what actually happens: We migrate all your client data for you - you send us a CSV export and we handle the rest. Your team gets live training sessions, and we're available via chat and phone during your first 30 days. Most practices are fully operational in under a week, and many run both systems in parallel for the first month if that makes them more comfortable. Compare one week of transition to the 2-3 hours per week you'll save forever on administrative tasks. That's 150+ hours saved in your first year alone."

**Proof Points:**
- "Our average client is fully onboarded in 5-7 days"
- "We provide white-glove data migration at no extra cost"
- "You'll have a dedicated onboarding specialist for your first 30 days"

**Overcome with Confidence:**
> "Let me ask you this - if I could guarantee that switching takes less than one week of your time, and that you'd save at least 2 hours per week afterwards, would it be worth it?"

---

### 3. "That's expensive / We can't afford that right now"

**Objection Type:** Price Concern

**Response Strategy:**
- Reframe as investment, not expense
- Break down ROI in concrete terms
- Compare to cost of not switching

**Sample Response (Professional Plan at $197/mo):**
> "I appreciate you being direct about budget. Let's look at what $197 per month actually means for your practice. That's about $6.50 per day. Our AI features alone - like the treatment recommender and no-show predictor - typically save our clients 5-7 hours per week in administrative work and reduce no-shows by 40%. If you're paying a staff member $20/hour, that's $100-$140 in labor savings per week, or $5,000-$7,000 per year. Plus, our clients average a 35% increase in rebooking rates from automated follow-ups. If you do just 10 services per week at $200 each, that's an extra $3,640 per year from improved retention alone. So you're looking at $8,000-$10,000+ in value from a $2,364 annual investment. Does that math make sense for your practice?"

**For "Can't Afford" Specifically:**
> "I understand cash flow is tight. Here's what I can do - we have a Starter plan at $97/month that includes all core features. You can upgrade when you're ready. Many of our most successful practices started there. Would that work better for your current situation?"

**Alternative Angle - Cost of Inaction:**
> "I get it - $197 feels like a lot. But consider this: if you're losing just 2 clients per month to poor follow-up, and each client is worth $2,000 in lifetime value, that's $48,000 in lost revenue per year. Our automated marketing and SMS reminders recover those relationships. Can you afford *not* to make this investment?"

---

### 4. "We need to think about it / I need to talk to my partner"

**Objection Type:** Delay Tactic / Decision Avoidance

**Response Strategy:**
- Respect their process but maintain momentum
- Uncover the real objection
- Create urgency without pressure

**Sample Response:**
> "Absolutely, this is an important decision and I want you to feel confident about it. Before we hang up, can I ask - what specifically do you need to think over? Is it the pricing, the implementation timeline, or something about the features? I want to make sure you have all the information you need for that conversation with your partner."

**Uncover Real Objection:**
- "On a scale of 1-10, how excited are you about what we've discussed?"
- "What would need to be true for this to be an easy 'yes'?"
- "If price wasn't a factor, would you move forward today?"

**Create Soft Urgency:**
> "I completely understand. We're currently in our early launch phase and offering 20% off the first year for practices that join before [date]. I can hold that pricing for you until [specific date] if that helps with your decision timeline. Does that work?"

---

### 5. "We're too small for this / We don't need all these features"

**Objection Type:** Size/Complexity Concern

**Response Strategy:**
- Reframe as growth enabler
- Show scalability
- Emphasize what they need now

**Sample Response:**
> "That's actually the perfect profile for our platform. Many of our best clients started as solo practitioners or small teams. Here's the thing - you don't have to use every feature on day one. Most practices start with scheduling, client management, and automated reminders. As you grow, you layer in the AI features, marketing automation, and advanced analytics. The platform grows with you. What matters is that you're not paying for features you don't use - our Starter plan at $97/month includes everything a small practice needs, and you're not locked into a long-term contract. If you outgrow us, no problem. But what usually happens is practices scale faster because they have professional tools from the start."

**Flip the Script:**
> "Here's a question - do you *want* to stay small, or do you want to grow? Because the practices that scale are the ones that put systems in place early. If you wait until you're 'big enough,' you'll spend years doing things manually that could have been automated from the start."

---

### 6. "I've been burned by software before"

**Objection Type:** Trust/Risk Concern

**Response Strategy:**
- Validate their experience
- Differentiate your support
- Offer proof and guarantees

**Sample Response:**
> "I'm sorry you went through that - unfortunately it's too common in this industry. Can I ask what happened? [Listen] That's exactly why we built our support model differently. You get a dedicated onboarding specialist, live training, and we're available via phone and chat 6 days a week. We also offer a 30-day money-back guarantee - if it's not working for you in the first month, we'll refund your entire payment, no questions asked. Plus, we'll migrate your data back out if needed. You're not locked in. Does that address your concern?"

**Build Credibility:**
- "We have [X] medical spas and aesthetic practices using our platform"
- "Our average client support rating is [X]/5 stars"
- "Here are three clients you can call directly to ask about their experience: [provide references]"

---

### 7. "Can we do a free trial first?"

**Objection Type:** Risk Mitigation

**Response Strategy:**
- Acknowledge the request
- Explain why trials don't work well (if you don't offer them)
- Offer alternative risk mitigation

**Sample Response (If No Free Trial):**
> "I appreciate you wanting to test-drive it - that makes total sense. We actually don't offer free trials because we found that practices don't properly implement the system without commitment, and then they don't see the real results. What we do instead is offer a 30-day money-back guarantee *and* include free white-glove onboarding. So you get your data migrated, your team trained, and you can use the full platform for 30 days. If you're not seeing the value, we refund you completely. It's actually lower risk than a trial because we're guaranteeing results. Does that work?"

**Sample Response (If You Offer Trials):**
> "Absolutely! We offer a 14-day free trial with full access to all features. I'll set you up right now. The only thing I ask is that you actually use it - schedule a few clients, send some SMS reminders, try the AI treatment recommender. I'll check in with you on day 3 and day 7 to make sure you're getting value from it. Sound good?"

---

### 8. "What if I need a feature you don't have?"

**Objection Type:** Feature Gap Concern

**Response Strategy:**
- Be honest about roadmap
- Show flexibility
- Focus on core value

**Sample Response:**
> "Great question - what feature specifically are you looking for? [Listen] That's on our roadmap for [timeframe] OR That's not something we've built yet, but we prioritize our roadmap based on client requests. If you join, you'd have a direct line to our product team to advocate for that feature. That said, I want to be upfront - if [specific feature] is absolutely mission-critical for your practice right now, we might not be the right fit yet. But let me ask - what percentage of your daily workflow does that feature represent? Because 90% of what you do - scheduling, client management, payments, marketing, reporting - we handle beautifully. Would it make sense to use us for the core and supplement with [other tool] for that one piece?"

---

### 9. "I need to see a demo / I need more time with the platform"

**Objection Type:** Information Gathering (Legitimate)

**Response Strategy:**
- Provide immediate access
- Structure the demo experience
- Set next steps

**Sample Response:**
> "Perfect - I can set you up with a demo account right now, or we can schedule a live walkthrough where I show you exactly how to [accomplish their specific goals]. Which would you prefer? [If they choose demo account] Great, I'll send you login credentials within the hour. I'm also going to send you a quick-start checklist so you know what to test. Let's schedule 30 minutes for [specific date/time] where you can show me what you've explored and ask any questions. Does [time] work?"

---

### 10. "We're seasonal / We're too busy right now to switch"

**Objection Type:** Timing Concern

**Response Strategy:**
- Acknowledge their cycle
- Reframe timing
- Schedule future follow-up

**Sample Response:**
> "I totally get it - you're in your busy season and switching sounds overwhelming. Here's what I'd suggest: let's get you set up during this busy period *because* that's when you need the automation most. You don't have to migrate everything at once. We can set up just automated reminders and online booking to take pressure off your front desk immediately. Then during your slow season, we'll do the full data migration and advanced setup. Does that make more sense? OR Alternatively, when does your slow season start? Let's schedule onboarding for [specific month] so you're ready to scale when busy season hits again."

---

## General Objection Handling Framework

### The 4-Step Method:

1. **Listen & Validate** - Let them fully express their concern
   - "I understand..."
   - "That makes sense..."
   - "I hear this a lot..."

2. **Clarify** - Make sure you understand the real objection
   - "Can you tell me more about that?"
   - "What specifically concerns you about..."
   - "Help me understand..."

3. **Respond** - Address the concern directly with specifics
   - Use data, examples, testimonials
   - Reframe the concern as an opportunity
   - Compare to alternatives

4. **Confirm** - Make sure you've resolved it
   - "Does that address your concern?"
   - "What questions do you still have?"
   - "If we can solve for that, are you ready to move forward?"

## Competitive Comparison Talking Points

### vs. Mindbody / Vagaro / Boulevard
**They say:** "We use Mindbody"
**You say:** "Mindbody is great for fitness and general wellness, but it wasn't built for medical-grade aesthetic practices. We're purpose-built for medical spas with features like HIPAA compliance, medical consent forms, AI treatment recommendations, and before/after photo galleries. Plus, our AI features like no-show prediction and dynamic pricing are saving our clients 5-10 hours per week compared to their old systems."

### vs. Acuity / Calendly (Simple Scheduling Tools)
**They say:** "We just use Acuity for scheduling"
**You say:** "Acuity is perfect for simple appointment scheduling, but you're missing the business intelligence layer. We show you which services are most profitable, which clients are at risk of churning, and automatically suggest the right treatments to each client. It's the difference between a calendar and a growth engine."

### vs. "We built our own system / Use spreadsheets"
**They say:** "We have a system that works for us"
**You say:** "I respect that - you've clearly figured out a process. But let me ask: how much time are you spending maintaining that system? What happens when your key person takes a vacation? And are you capturing insights like lifetime client value, retention rates, and service profitability? Our clients who switched from custom solutions typically recover 15-20 hours per week and discover revenue opportunities they never knew existed."

## Closing Techniques

### The Assumptive Close
"Great! Let me get you set up. Which plan makes the most sense for your practice size - Starter or Professional?"

### The Alternative Close
"Would you like to start with our Starter plan at $97/month, or go straight to Professional for the full AI features?"

### The Timeline Close
"Perfect - shall we target [specific date] for your go-live date? That gives us a week for data migration and training."

### The Urgency Close
"We're offering 20% off the first year for practices that join before [date]. I have a few slots left this week to get you that pricing. Does [day] or [day] work better?"

### The Direct Close
"Based on everything we've discussed, this sounds like a great fit for your practice. Are you ready to move forward?"

---

## Red Flags (When to Walk Away)

- They want extensive custom development before committing
- They're not the decision maker and won't connect you with who is
- They have no budget and no timeline for budget
- They're comparing 10+ vendors with no urgency
- They expect 24/7 support or instant response times you can't provide
- They want to pay month-to-month but expect enterprise-level customization

**Remember:** Not every prospect is a good client. Focus on practices that value what you've built and are ready to grow.

## Final Tips

1. **Listen more than you talk** - The best salespeople ask great questions
2. **Address objections early** - Don't wait for them to bring up price
3. **Tell stories** - "We had a client in Austin who..." is more powerful than features
4. **Be consultative, not pushy** - You're solving problems, not selling software
5. **Follow up persistently** - Most sales happen after the 5th touchpoint
6. **Ask for referrals** - Your best clients know others like them

**Remember:** You're not just selling software - you're selling growth, freedom, and professionalism. Every feature solves a real pain point. Keep that front and center.
