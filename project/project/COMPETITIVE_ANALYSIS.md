# SpaStream Competitive Analysis 2025

## Executive Summary

SpaStream enters a crowded but fragmented medical spa software market with a unique positioning: **medical spa specialization + AI-powered intelligence at mid-market pricing**. Our analysis of 6 key competitors reveals significant market gaps that SpaStream is uniquely positioned to fill.

### Key Findings:

1. **Pricing Gap**: Most competitors either low-end ($25-$165/mo) or high-end ($300-$600+/mo). SpaStream's $299-$1,499 pricing bridges this gap with premium features at accessible prices.

2. **AI Differentiation**: No competitor offers comprehensive AI features (treatment recommendations, no-show prediction, dynamic pricing, staff optimization) - this is SpaStream's biggest differentiator.

3. **All-in-One vs. Add-Ons**: Competitors nickel-and-dime with essential features as costly add-ons. SpaStream includes all core features in base tiers.

4. **Medical Spa Focus**: Most competitors serve general salon/spa market. Only RepeatMD and AestheticsPro focus exclusively on medical spas like SpaStream.

5. **Platform Fee Model**: SpaStream's 2% platform fee (only on volume over $50k/month) is transparent and fair compared to hidden fees and payment processing markups from competitors.

- Treatment-specific workflows (injectables, lasers, body contouring)
- Before/after photo management with annotation
- Medical-grade inventory tracking
- Consent forms and intake documentation
- Integration with medical payment plans

- All core features (booking, clients, calendar, payments, invoicing)
- SMS marketing and reminders
- Inventory management
- Staff management

- HIPAA compliance
- AI features (Professional tier and above)

**Competitors nickel-and-dime:**

- Vagaro: SMS costs $20-400/mo extra
- Boulevard/Zenoti: Opaque pricing with add-ons

- Industry-low 2% fee only on excess over $50k (still 31% cheaper than standard 2.9%)

- Aligned with customer success (we win when you win)
- No hidden processing markups

**Revenue Examples:**

- **vs. Competitor at 2.9% on ALL volume:** $100k would cost $2,900/month = **$1,900/month savings ($22,800/year)**
- **vs. Competitor at 2.9% on ALL volume:** $150k would cost $4,350/month = **$2,350/month savings ($28,200/year)**
